    "### 1. What is Perlin Noise?\n",
    "So, what is Perlin Noise? If you hear this term for the first time in your life, it may sound really complicated, but believe me, it's really just some high school math and a lot of creativity. The Perlin Noise is just a gradient noise, which looks way more natural than the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise](white noise) we see sometimes for example when the connection between the TV and the reciever is bad. The Perlin Noise was developed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Perlin](Ken Perlin in) 1983 (way older than minecraft). He created it as a result of a frustration with the \"machine-like\" look of the CGI by that time. Perlin developed it after working on Disney's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron](Tron (1982)). "
